# Chess.com Top Players Activity Analysis

## Description and Purpose
In this ongoing project, I analyze the profiles, ratings, activity, and game statistics of Chess.com leaders.

The analysis allows understanding:  
1. Which factors influence top players’ performance (frequency of games, time controls, win/loss ratios);
2. How leaders’ activity changes over time;
3. Which strategies or openings are most common among top players;
4. How stable leaders’ rankings are over time.

This research helps identify patterns in the behavior of successful players and combines behavioral analysis with game analysis, providing a foundation for predicting future performance and developing tools to analyze games.

# Data
No CSV files are included. Data is fetched directly from the Chess.com API (the method is described in the file [chesscom_stat_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/OlhaHaidash/data_analysis_pet_projects/blob/main/chesscom_data_analysis/chesscom_stat_analysis.ipynb). Running the scripts will create local CSV files for analysis.
